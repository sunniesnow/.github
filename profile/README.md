Go to the Discord server to find charts to play and ask questions.

## Writing charts

Unfortunately, we do not currently have a GUI charting tool.
The current best charting tool is [sscharter](https://github.com/sunniesnow/sscharter).
Read its [tutorial](https://github.com/sunniesnow/sscharter/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.md) if you want to learn it.
You can also check out the [tutorial video](https://youtu.be/0XgkRAODtFE).

Go to the Discord server to ask questions and discuss charting techniques with other charters.
